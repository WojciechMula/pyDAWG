pydawg module installation
==========================

Compile time settings (can be change in setup.py):

* ``DAWG_UNICODE`` --- if defined, DAWG accepts and returns
  unicode strings, else bytes are supported

* ``DAWG_PERFECT_HASHING`` --- when defined, minimal perfect
  hashing is enabled (methods word2index and index2word are
  available)


Just run::

		$ python setup.py install

If compilation succed, module is ready to use.
